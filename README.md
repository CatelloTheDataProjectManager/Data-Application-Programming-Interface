# Data-Application-Programming-Interface

## Overview

This repository contains the development of a Data Application Programming Interface (API) using Python. The project focuses on creating robust backend and frontend functionalities to manage and manipulate data efficiently.

## Features

- **Backend Development**: Handles backend operations including data storage, retrieval, and processing.
- **Frontend Development**: Manages frontend interactions, ensuring smooth data flow and user experience.

- **Python**: Primary programming language for both backend and frontend development.
- **Flask/Django**: Frameworks used for API development.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions.

## Application Front-End

The front-end of the application is designed to provide an intuitive and efficient user experience. Each section is carefully crafted to allow users to easily interact with data and the application's features.

- **Login**: The login interface allows users to securely access the application. It is designed to be simple and effective, ensuring ease of use.
- **Data Visualization**: This section provides users with interactive visualizations of data. Users can view various metrics and trends through dynamic charts and graphs.
- **Data Extraction**: The data extraction feature enables users to pull data from different sources. It includes options to filter and sort data for better analysis.
- **Dynamic Data Table**: A dynamic data table is integrated to display data in a tabular format. Users can manipulate the table to view and organize data as needed.
- **Administration**: The administration panel allows for user management and system configuration. It provides tools to manage roles, permissions, and other administrative tasks.
- **Data Integration**: The data integration feature allows the application to connect with external APIs, such as the Open-Meteo Weather API, to fetch and integrate additional data seamlessly.

This comprehensive setup ensures that the application is both functional and user-friendly, providing a robust solution for data management and analysis.
